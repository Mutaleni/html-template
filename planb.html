   <p>Vera had reached the age where her future had become predictable. She was already an unsatisfied woman. Fatigued by the effort of her high maintenance beauty regime but trapped by the comforting routine that at once exacerbated and appeased her natural anxiety. She watched as the two girls walked across the hot sand to the sugar cane drink stand. She was proud she didnâ€™t have any daughters. She was always sure to congratulate herself on things she had had no choice in. She stubbed her cigarette out in a pot plant and re-entered the hotel through the service door. </p>

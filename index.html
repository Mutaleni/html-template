   <p>Set in Namibia just after independence in 1990, <em>The Second Coming of Mavala Shikongo</em> takes place at Goas, a Catholic farm school near Karibib. Larry Kaplanski, a young American volunteer, lands at Goas to teach English and History. The title character, Mavala Shikongo, teacher of the sub b’s, is a disaffected ex-freedom fighter who can take an AK-47 apart in 17 seconds and has ‘gravity-defying’ balance in stiletto heels. The subject of much unrequited desire, she is silent about her past, and enigmatic about the future. </p>

    <em>"It is a work on Africa that belongs in Africa… Though it is universal, it is grounded in Namibian realities, including the guerrilla war, its accomplishments and abuses, and even the German genocide in 1904… Unforgettable characters."</em>
 - Sheridan Griswold, <em>The Namibian Weekender</em>
